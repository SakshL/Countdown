# ⏳ Countdown Timer Website

This is a simple and interactive **Countdown Timer** website I created to practice DOM manipulation using vanilla **JavaScript**, as well as styling using **HTML** and **CSS**. The timer lets users set a date and time, and then counts down in real time until the target is reached.

## 🎯 Features

- ⏱ Live countdown display (days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- 📆 Input for selecting a custom future date
- 📦 Clean and minimal UI
- 🔔 Optional: Alert or message when countdown reaches zero (if implemented)
